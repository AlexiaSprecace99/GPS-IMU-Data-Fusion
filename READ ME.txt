This text document presents all matlab scripts and the order in which to execute them.

Simulated Data:
Trajectory creation -> first to execute. It creates the trajectory to use in Kalman filter.
To execute independently ->
KF -> script for Kalman filter.
KF_classical_logic -> script for Kalman filter with classical logic. 
KF_fuzzy_logic -> script for Kalman filter with fuzzy logic.

get_mf_valid -> creates membership function for fuzzy logic.

Real Data:
Initialization -> first to execute. Contains all variable for Kalman filter.
To execute independently ->
KF -> script for Kalman filter.
KF_classical_logic -> script for Kalman filter with classical logic. 
KF_fuzzy_logic -> script for Kalman filter with fuzzy logic.
